                <h2>Welcome to AUTO4SALE</h2>
                <p>WHERE WE SHOWCASE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CARS IN THE WORLD </p>
                <p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. When we test a car, we examine numerous factors including performance, in-car tech, comfort, and value, but we normally leave looks alone. We’re conscious lines we go head-over-feet for could easily be considered offensive by someone else, and vice versa.</p>
                <p>While it’s difficult to pin down exactly what makes a car beautiful and what doesn’t, we can’t deny some models end up associated with the term far more often than others. Here are some of our picks for the honor of being named the most beautiful cars ever made.</p>
                <p>The functional lines have remained almost unchanged over the course of the  unusually long production run. They’ve held up so well , though it now carries a supercar-like price tag. The roadster has also inspired countless replicas based on a dizzying array of vehicles. We’ve even seen platforms. Talk about all show and no go!</p>

                <a href="sport.html"><img src="images/images%20png%20104.jpg"/></a>
                <p>Sports Car - A small low car with a high-powered engine; usually seats two persons.Sports cars handle better,they are faster,they stop faster,better quality and cost more then ordinary cars.</p><br><br>
                <p>SUV</p>
                <a href="suv.html"><img src="images/images%20png%20204.jpg"/>
                <p>SUVs typically have high ground clearance and a tall body. Unless the SUV is powered by a battery in the floor, this results in a high center of mass, which makes gasoline-powered SUVs more prone to roll-over accidents.[34][35] In 2003, SUVs were quoted as 2.5 times more likely to roll over in a crash than regular cars and that SUV roofs are more likely to cave in on passengers than in other cars, resulting in increased harm to passengers</p></a><br><br>
                <p>JEEP</p>
                <a href="jeep.html"><img src="images/images%20png%20304.jpg"/></a>
                <p>Jeep advertising has always emphasized the brand's vehicles' off-road capabilities.[42] Today, the Wrangler is one of the few remaining four-wheel-drive vehicles with solid front and rear axles. These axles are known for their durability, strength, and articulation. New Wranglers come with a Dana 44 rear differential and a Dana 30 front differential. The upgraded Rubicon model of the JK Wrangler is equipped with electronically activated locking differentials, Dana 44 axles front and rear with 4.10 gears, a 4:1 transfer case, electronic sway bar disconnect, and heavy-duty suspension.</p><br><br>
                <p>CLASSIC</p>
                <a href="classic.html"><img src="images/images%20png%20404.jpg"/></a>
                <p>Classic cars are typically built to meet the national car emission levels that were present in the year of production of the vehicle. EU and US emission standards have increased in many countries since then. As a result, they may not be allowed to enter cities with special emission restrictions or low emission zones.[21][22][23][24] Converting the car to run on a different fuel (i.e. SVO, LPG, CNG, hydrogen, ...) may decrease emission levels.</p>
